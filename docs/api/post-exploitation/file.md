# File Operations API

The OFX File Operations API provides utilities for reading, writing, uploading, and downloading files during post-exploitation and automation workflows.

---

## Features
- Read and write files on the local filesystem
- Integrate file operations into OFX workflows and Python steps

---

## Usage in Python
```python
from ofx.api.file import read_file, write_file

# Read a file
content = read_file("/etc/passwd")
print(content)

# Write a file
write_file("loot.txt", "secret data")
```

---

## Usage in Workflow YAML
```yaml
steps:
	- name: Read a file in a workflow
		script: |
			from ofx.api.file import read_file
			content = read_file("local_file.txt")
			print(content)
		outputs:
			file_content: "{{ step.stdout }}"
```

---

## Tips
- Always check permissions before file operations
- Clean up sensitive files after use
- Use outputs to pass file contents between steps
