Integrate post-exploitation tasks into your OFX workflows for automated data collection, persistence, and cleanup after exploitation.

## Example: Post-Exploitation Workflow
```yaml
jobs:
	exploit:
		steps:
			- run: python exploit.py
	post:
		needs: exploit
		steps:
			- run: python collect_loot.py
			- run: ./persistence.sh
			- run: ./cleanup.sh
```

## Common Post-Exploitation Tasks
- Data exfiltration
- Credential dumping
- Persistence setup
- Cleanup and log removal

---

## Tips
- Chain post-exploitation jobs after successful exploitation
- Use outputs to pass data between jobs
- Automate cleanup to reduce detection risk
