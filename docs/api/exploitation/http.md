# HTTP Client API

The OFX HTTP client module provides utilities for sending HTTP requests, handling responses, and automating web interactions in workflows and Python scripts.

---

## Features
- Send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and custom HTTP requests
- Set headers, cookies, and authentication
- Handle JSON, text, and binary responses
- Integrate with OFX workflows and step outputs

---

## Usage in Python
```python
from ofx.api.http import requests

# Simple GET request
resp = requests.get("https://example.com")
print(resp.status_code, resp.text)

# POST with data
resp = requests.post("https://api.example.com/login", data={"user": "admin", "pass": "secret"})
print(resp.json())
```

---

## Usage in Workflow YAML
```yaml
steps:
	- name: Fetch Data
		run: |
			from ofx.api.http import requests
			resp = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
			print(resp.text)
		script:
		outputs:
			data: "{{ step.stdout }}"
```

## Tips
- Use `resp.json()` for JSON APIs
- Set custom headers with `headers={...}`
- Handle errors with try/except in Python steps
